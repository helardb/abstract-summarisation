    "roman_history_transcript = \"But the advantage of talking to you, even on an inconvenient day is Diocletian. We don't use terms, in the professional world of history, like \\\"awesome\\\" very much, but the guy certainly deserves that. He rescued the Roman Empire, and we'll begin by saying what he rescued it from. As a preliminary, the sections are meeting this week, if you're waitlisted for a session-section, just go to it. We will have enough sections for however many people take this course. Right? so there are currently four, the additional ones that were added since last week are Wednesday at 2:30 and Thursday at 7. And again, if you're waitlisted, just go. We'll figure this out, there will be enough sections for everybody. So I referred last time to the third century crisis. The crisis of the Roman Empire that preceded the accession of Diocletian from 235 to 284. And we mentioned several interrelated weaknesses of the Empire that might be seen as long-term causes of this crisis. The size of the empire, its sheer, massive size; the problem of succession, that is it was never quite clear how one emperor succeeded another; the urban-rural imbalance, this was an empire built on cities, and to some extent, although heavily debated among historians to what extent, but to some extent, the cities may be said to have drained off the energy, or been parasites on the productivity of the countryside. It was an empire that was according to one point of view more cosmopolitan than it had been, according to another point of view, more barbarian. In other words, this was an empire whose roman population was less dominant, partly through its success in co-opting other peoples. Some of the peoples that it coopted were not actually originally inhabitants of the empire. Particularly this is visible in the armies which tended to be staffed by so called barbarian tribes. So-called by the romans, who referred to them as barbarians. Another problem is the east-west imbalance, where the east tends to do better economically and demographically than the west. Demographically meaning population. We live in a world when one of the great threats is over-population. It is therefore not self-evident, although true, that for most of the time historically, most places have trouble reproducing their population. And indeed, we are starting to enter a period of great demographic decline. The infant mortality, the low life expectancy, the death of women in childbirth, the prevalence of disease, and to some extent, miliary threats of invasion, or if not threats, the reality, made it hard for one generation to produce children to replace itself.  And this is true up until the dawn of modernity. So, these are fundamental problems of the Roman Empire, the real question is, why do they explode in the third century. And this is a question, as I think I said last week, with any great empire. It's easy to point to the flaws in a complicated system. Often size is one of them, often bureaucracy, often overspending on the military. But some of these go on for a very long time, more or less successfully, despite the flaws. The roman empire went on longer than most, as we said. The immediate problems that explode in the third century are invasions and succession. Invasions by first of all Persia. Persia is the old enemy of the Roman Empire, indeed as many of you know, the old enemy of the Greek city states that precede the Roman Empire, as far back as the first historian of the Western tradition, Herodotus. First week of directed studies, for those of you who are nostalgic for that experience. Persia is the enemy. Now we never study Persia, it's kind of offstage all the time. And that's the great benefit of the department of near eastern languages and cultures, if you want to learn about Persia, really from within, instead of as oh my god the Persians, and oh my god the Persians in 370BC. And it's going to come to an end, it is going to come to an end in the 7th century. But that's because of Islam, just to anticipate. But in the 3rd century, Persia becomes resurgent. Having been rather passive, it has this frontier with Roman Empire in the near east. More or less buffer states are Mesopotamia, present day Iraq, and Armenia, which is not exactly the same as the present-day state of Armenia but more like eastern Turkey. The dynasty that the controls Persia and that is more aggressive than its predecessor are the Sassanids. And this appears in your reading.  The Sassanid dynasty, the rulers of Persia, just more aggressive and more adventurous. Beginning in 224, they start to probe that frontier along the Armenian and Mesopotamian border, and eventually cross it and start to wreak havoc in some of the eastern provinces of the roman empire. The climax of this is the Emperor Valerian was captured by the Persians in 260. Valerian actually one of the longer reigning emperors of this chaotic period, 253 to 260. They kept him for a little while, displayed him in chains, maybe flayed him. Anyway, he died in captivity. They did a kind of a job on him. Think maybe he was flayed after he died, just not to be too gruesome, but I think they displayed the skin. As I said I\\'m not a Persian specialist. But the second invasion is a across the Danube-Rhine frontier.\"\n",

    "joyce_transcript = \"Thank you very much, Anne, for that very kind and very full introduction. It's a great pleasure to be here. As a non-joist, and as Anne mentioned, I'll have to keep reiterating that to make sure my cultural insecurity doesn't explode. I was lucky enough to be introduced to Joyce by Gus Martin when he was teaching here at the very end of the 1980s, and it certainly struck me that the historian in me, the budding historian in me, would have to keep particularly attuned to what Joyce might have to say to the historian about how they might characterize them of the earlier decades of the 20th century. And I suppose I have been thinking about that in various forms over the last 10 or 15 years. It's very important, I think, for the historians of modern Ireland to look at our great writers, to look at some of the literature and how it might be used in terms of how we characterize the evolution of Irish nationalism, the evolution of Irish society, the evolution of Irish politics over the course of the 20th century. And it's one of the reasons why I was delighted to accept Anne's invitation was to try and give you some sense of historical perspective about this crucial period, 1922 to 1939. I do remember some of those earlier lectures in the late 1980s about a portrait of the artist in particular, the sense in which Steven is grappling with all sorts of legacies of events of the late 19th century into the early 20th century in particular. How they are played out in subsequent decades is really what I want to talk about today. And it also, of course, coincides with a crucial period for Joyce. So that I think is why I am here, it's why I'm very grateful to be here. I'm delighted to see such an interesting and diverse audience. I do hope that some of the historical issues of such parenthood importance during this period that we will begin to look at them in a variety of different ways, through a variety of different prisons. There are all sorts of different perspectives that have emerged on the free state as it became in 1922 during its crucial formative decades, the 1920s and the 1930s. And I really just want to give you a flavor of where we are at now with regard to how we might interpret the 1920s and the 1930s. What were the particular challenges that were there? What were the particular issues that were at stake? What were the particular impulses that were at work? And what were the defining characteristics of that state as it emerges in the shadow of civil war in 1922 and 1923? That's an island, of course, that James Joyce had long left. It had been 1912 since he had been in Ireland. That era, of course, is warm, in which it was quite clear that there were certain stirrings at work with regard to cultural nationalism, with regards to political nationalism, though in perhaps a quite understated way. What's fascinating about the 10 years after Joyce had left Ireland is the degree to which many of those tensions, which had been bubbling beneath the surface, come to the surface. And many of them become very difficult to manage and the legacy and the fallout from those crucial years is one that arguably is still with us today. So I would be very conscious as we enter a period of commemorating 100 years of the events that ultimately led to the establishment of the Free State. I would be very conscious that we need to bring to bear some kind of historical context, some type of historical perspective. Whilst keeping at the back of our minds, of course, this fundamental question of Joyce and where we situate him and how he might have viewed some of these particular events and some of these particular individuals. That period, 1922 to 1939, and has suggested, is one of those periods that is critical to an evaluation of James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake in particular. It's very interesting that he begins that particular work at the same time as the beginnings of the Free State in 1922. It's also significant, I would think, that that book is published in 1939 at a very time when it becomes clear that this Free State is entering another phase, the beginning of the Second World War, the culmination of many of the Irish attempts in the 1920s and the 1930s to maximize sovereignty in order to be able to maintain its neutrality in the event of a global conflict. And that's precisely what happens, or certainly a version of it in 1939. So in that sense, that time span of 1922 to 1939 is a crucial period for Joyce, obviously. Post-Julius says, post this huge, huge, challenging gauntlet that has been laid down in terms of his future work, but also that crucial decade for the Free State. When we think of Joyce and his great work in progress, as it was labeled between 1922 and this publication in 1939, we can also think of the work in progress in terms of building the solid foundations of the Irish Free State, what ultimately became the Republic in the late 1940s. So you do have those parallel streams, if you like, which I think are particularly pertinent today.\"\n",

    "blood_brain_transcript = \"Welcome to 2 Minute Neuroscience where I simplistically explain neuroscience topics in 2 minutes or less. In this installment, I will discuss the blood brain barrier. The blood brain barrier is a complex that surrounds most of the blood vessels in the brain. It acts as a barrier between the bloodstream and the extracellular space of the brain, allowing only certain substances like water, oxygen, and small lipid-soluble substances to easily cross from the blood into the brain. This prevents toxins, pathogens, and other potentially dangerous substances from crossing from the circulatory system into the brain. It is thought that the central components of the structure of the blood brain barrier are the tight junctions of endothelial cells, the cells that make up the interior surface of blood vessels. In other blood vessels throughout the body, there are small spaces between these endothelial cells. Small, blood-borne substances can pass through these spaces and into surrounding tissues. The endothelial cells that make up the blood brain barrier, however, are fused tightly together to form tight junctions that restrict diffusion across the blood vessel lining. Glial cells called astrocytes also have projections called astrocytic N-feet that extend to the walls of blood vessels that are part of the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytic N-feet often completely surround blood vessels in the brain, and are thought to play critical roles in the formation of the blood-brain barrier. For example, they seem to be involved with signaling that prompts endothelial cells to form the tight junctions necessary to create the blood-brain barrier, and they are believed to have multiple functions involving the maintenance and regulation of the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier protects most of the blood vessels in the brain, but there are some areas that lack a blood-brain barrier, allowing substances to pass from the circulatory system to the brain and back. For example, the circumfentricular organs are a group of structures lacking a blood-brain barrier that are centered around the ventricles of the brain. These structures are thought to be lacking a blood-brain barrier because their functions require access to the blood-stream. The posterior pituitary gland, for example, has to be able to release hormones directly into the blood-stream.\"\n",

    "astrophysics_transcript = \"Hi, I'm Antonio Martin Carrigio, an astrophysics lecturer at UCD. Today, I'm going to be talking about astrophysics and how it is connected to many different areas of physics and other scientists such as biology, chemistry and geology. Personally, I've always wanted to be an astrophysicist and one of the reasons is precisely because studying astrophysics or working in this area allows me to interact with so many other aspects of science. Unlike biology, chemistry or other areas of physics, astrophysics cannot control the lab. Our experiments depend on what the sky is showing us at that moment, but however, I personally feel that that is also part of the fun. It's like playing detective, but making it a bit more challenging since you cannot move to the scene of the crime. The good news is that this kind of a sky lap is really vast, rich on stars, galaxies enabling and therefore, after years of investigation, collecting data and discoveries, we have managed to start getting solid answers to some of our questions. Probably one of the most common questions that we ask ourselves is, how did we get here? This question is a very good example of what I mentioned earlier about the connection between astrophysics and other disciplines. To answer it, we will need to cover aspects of chemistry, particle physics, nuclear physics, spectroscopy and relativity among others. Let's have a look at the periodic table of elements. These are all the known elements that make up the universe, from the simplest of all, hydrogen, to more complex ones like gold, platinum or lead. If we look at the composition of the universe, we realize that the most common element in the entire universe is hydrogen followed by helium. When the universe began with the big band, these two were the only elements in the universe, the building blocks of everything else. One would expect that if hydrogen is so common, we should be able to detect it almost everywhere and we do. Let's have a look at this image of the Horsehead Nebula. At the red, you can see here is hydrogen lit up by the blue light of those bright stars that you can see in the image. As shown here, what is happening is that the blue light is exciting the electron, that is making the electron jump from its normal orbit to a higher one. In doing this, the atoms and molecules of hydrogen are absorbing the blue light of the stars. After a while, the electron moves back to its normal level. While it does that, it emits light. In this particular case, the light emitted is very specific and it's mostly in the red part of the rainbow. These emissions can be seen in multiple areas of our galaxy, like here in the Horsehead Nebula and in other galaxies, like these two that you can see here. All the red or pinkish points on the galaxy on the right would be an area with high concentration of hydrogen. These regions are not only important to show that hydrogen is very abundant. They are also birth places for hundreds or thousands of new stars. So a galaxy with loads of red areas is telling us that it's very active in star formation. Now remember that our goal is to know how we got here. So it seems natural to us how the universe went from only hydrogen and helium to having heavier, more complex elements. You can see that even though the heavier elements, oxygen, carbon, aluminum, calcium, only make up a tiny fraction of the universe, they are the ones that dominate our planet and our life. So knowing how they were and are being produced is crucial to find the answer to our main question.\"\n",

    "maths_transcript = \"Hello everyone, welcome to Analysis 1 video 26. At the end of the last video, I asked is it the case that every sequence has a convergent subsequence, and the answer was sort of immedieately no, because the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on does not have a convergent subsequence. The next question I asked was does every bounded sequence have a convergent subsequence. And that's what we're going to try to resolve now. And we're going to do that with something called the scenic viewpoints theorem, a maybe unusually poetic name, but I will draw you a picture in a moment that will hopefully help to explain it. What it says is that if the sequence An is a real sequence, then it has a monotone subsequence. And remember, monotone means increasing or decreasing. And you might already be thinking ahead to \\\"what will that tell us about bounded sequences\\\", but we won't rush ahead, we'll prove the sceneic viewpoints theorem first.Just a practical note for anybody who's interested, the reason i have gained this sort of strange glow is because i'm playing with the lighting in my kitchen to see whether I can illuminate my handwriting a big more helpfully for you. so this has involved complicated things, like dismanteling a bedside lamp and propping it on a kitchen table in a strange sort of way but hopefully it might help with the handwriting. So what's the idea of the scenic viewpoints theorem. Well let me try to draw a picture. Maybe I'll just draw that here. So i've got my usual axes for drawing a sequence, and I'll draw on some points of my sequence which might be positive or negative, they kind of hop around a bit, who knows what it is they do. Here we go, here's some points of a sequence. And a scenic viewpoint, or a peak of the sequence is going to be a point like this one up here, because this (is) point is kind of high up, and if we look forwards from this point, so look at later terms in the sequence, nothing gets in the way of the view. That is, all of the terms in the sequence later than this one are smaller. So this is a peak, or a scenic viewpoint. Let me try to find another one. The next one in the sequence isn't because there's another point in it that blocks the view, but then this point here is another peak. It's not as high as the previous peak. If you think about it for a moment, that's inevitable, because the previous one was a peak. But it is still a peak, because if we look later on, we still have an unimpeded view.  And then I guess as I've drawn it here, it looks like we've got another peak here and another peak here. I mean there are still another infinitely many terms of the sequence to come, who knows what might happen, but I hope the picture gives you the kind of idea. And what we're going to do to prove the scenic viewpoints thereom, which is to show that our sequence has a monotone subsequence is to think about two cases. So one case is where there are infinitely many peaks, and we will argue that they must form a decreasing sequence, so you might be able to see from the picture i've drawn already why they would form a decreasing sequence. The other case is where there are only finitely many of these peaks and that means that after some point, no point is a peak, and so there's always a later term of the sequence that's larger, and that's going to allow us to argue that there is an increasing subsequence. So that's the kind of executive summary of the proof. I will write that out carefully now. So we've got a real sequence, AN. We want to show it's got a monotone subsequence, and I am going to let V be the set of all K in the natural numbers such that if M is bigger than K, then AM is less than AK. So this is the set of peaks, or scenic viewpoints. So i'll just kind of put a little note in purple somehow these are the kind of peaks. This is not a technical term but hopefully this helps you to see how it relates to the picture that I showed you just now. So there are going to be two cases. Case one is where there are infinitely many of these. So what happens then? Well, let's say the elements of V are k1 less than k2 less than k3 so on forever. So just listing the elements of this set in order, because I want to pick out the subsequence, so ak subscript r, [cos] r there is a subsequence of An, and it must be decreasing, and is decreasing, because if r is less than s, then kr is less than ks, that's how we've constructed our ks, and so, akr is greater than aks, because we know that kr was a peak. So if aks comes later, then it must be smaller. So in that case we've got a decreasing subsequence. \"\n",

    "molecular_transcript = \"A molecular orbital theory, or MO theory, is the basis for much of what we'll study this term. The premise of this theory is that whenever orbitals, the regions of space where electrons can live, whenever they overlap, they make new orbitals. There are several key tenets to this theory, the first. When two orbitals overlap in phase, they make a new bonding orbital, which is lower in energy than the original orbitals. Second, when two orbitals overlap out of phase, they make a new anti-bonding orbital, which is higher in energy than the original orbitals. This anti-bonding orbital has a node orthogonal to the internuclear axis. Third, electrons populate the new molecular orbitals according to Hund's rule, the alkyl principle and the Pauli exclusion principle, just like they do in atoms. We can see these three principles in work in the MO diagram of hydrogen, H2. When the two H atoms, each with their 1S atomic orbitals, come near each other, they interact to make a bonding orbital and an anti-bonding orbital. The bonding orbital is low in energy and the anti-bonding orbital is high in energy. Since each hydrogen had one valence electron to begin with, we populate the molecular orbitals with two total electrons, starting with the lowest energy orbital first. The electrons in H2 occupy a sigma bonding orbital, sigma because the two individual atomic orbitals overlapped directly, and bonding because the majority of the orbital resides between the two nuclei. If an electron occupies this orbital, it holds the atoms together. H2 also has an empty anti-bonding orbital called a sigma star orbital, which looks like this. Because there's a node between the two nuclei, if an electron would occupy this orbital, it would push the atoms apart, hence anti-bonding. From a simple MO diagram like this, we can calculate the bond order for any group of atoms. It's calculated by taking the number of bonding electrons, subtracting the number of anti-bonding electrons, and dividing by two. For the neutral molecule H2, the bond order is 2 minus 0 divided by 2, or 1. There's a single bond between the two hydrogen atoms. How would this MO diagram change for the H2 1 minus ion? We'd have three total electrons to fill the molecular orbitals. So 2 would go in the bonding orbital, and the third would have to go in the anti-bonding orbital. If we calculate the bond order now, we see that it's 2 minus 1 over 2, or 1/2. There's only half a bond, much weaker than a single bond. So we can infer that this ion isn't very stable. In general, the lower the bond order, the weaker the bond.\"\n",

    "traits_transcript = \"Okay, just to pick back up on our videos for personality, we are going to end with the trait perspective on personality. We talked about this before in terms of, you know, when we think about how people are, we tend to think of them in terms of the traits that make up their personality. And so traits are, you know, these relatively stable, these enduring predispositions that we have to behave in a particular way. And, you know, when we look at the psychoanalytic, the humanistic and the social cognitive perspectives, what we find is that these are all focused on the similarities of people. The one thing that's different about the trait perspective is it actually focuses on the individual differences of people, not how similar we are, but how different we are. And so, of course, we see that trait theorists tend to focus on identifying, describing and measuring those differences in behavioral dispositions or those personalities. And they look at these pieces, these complete little pieces of what makes up you as a unique person as traits. And so these attributes are considered traits. And so when we look at how we can test this, okay, we can say that they are inferred from observable behavior. If you say that somebody is, you know, shy, you observe their behavior and see that they don't like to talk a lot to others. You see somebody is outgoing, they tend to sort of project themselves outward and talk to people and things like that. When we look at the English language, we have about 4,000 English words to describe personality traits. I mean, these descriptors will refer to a surface trait. Now what we see in terms of surface traits versus other kinds of traits, a surface trait to these sort of attributes that we get from observable behavior, but source traits are the fundamental, most fundamental dimension of personality. They're really broad and basic traits that are argued to be relatively few in number. And so these were kind of like where this sort of trait theory sort of started from.\"\n",

    "molecular_humansum = \"The lecture covers molecular orbital (MO) theory. This theory says that whenever orbitals overlap they create new orbitals and it's based on three principles. First, if the overlapping is in-phase, it creates a bonding orbital low in energy compared to the original orbitals. Second, if the overlap is out-of-phase, it results in an antibonding orbital, high in energy compared to the originals. Third, electrons populate the new orbitals according to established principles (just like with atoms). An example of these three principles in work is presented using the MO diagram of hydrogen H2. The bond order can be calculated using this MO diagram by subtracting the number of antibonding electrons from the bonding electrons and dividing the difference by two. The lower the bond order, the weaker the bond.\"\n",

    "molecular_LLMsum = \"MO theory describes how new orbitals form when atomic orbitals overlap:- Bonding orbitals have lower energy when orbitals overlap in phase.- Anti-bonding orbitals have higher energy when orbitals overlap out of phase.- Electrons fill the new molecular orbitals based on principles like Hund's rule. The MO diagram for H2 shows a bonding sigma orbital and an anti-bonding sigma* orbital. The two electrons occupy the bonding orbital, giving a bond order of 1. For H2-, the third electron goes into the anti-bonding orbital, reducing the bond order to 1/2 and weakening the bond.The bond order, calculated from bonding vs anti-bonding electrons, indicates the strength of the molecular bond. In summary, MO theory explains how overlapping atomic orbitals form new molecular orbitals that determine bond strength.\"\n",

Observable behaviour (e.g., to notice if someone is shy, or outgoing) helps us identify the so-called surface traits, high in number. On the other hand, source traits, considered as the fundamental dimensions of personality, are few in number.\"\n",

These \\\"surface traits\\\" based on behavior contrast with the fewer \\\"source traits\\\" that are the more fundamental dimensions of personality.
